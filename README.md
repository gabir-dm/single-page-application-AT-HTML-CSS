# Web Page with API - Congress Transparency Portal

A mostly non-functional Single Page Application created with HTML, CSS and Javascript as a small project for university.

My main objective with this application was to create a mock-up of a website that would consume data from an API
to pull congresspersons' pictures, names and parties in order to populate information cards.

As one of the first webpages I created, it has a very simple interface, with basic effects and almost no interactivity or smoothness in transitions.
Created solely with the intention of understanding how basic API requests work.
